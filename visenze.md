#Upgrade workflow
Suppose that we want to upgrade from 1.17 to 1.18
1. Pull the latest cost from the open source repository 
1. Create a new branch `release-1.18-eks` based on the open source branch `cluster-autoscaler-release-1.18`
1. Find the patch file `patch/1.17.patch` in the branch `release-1.17-eks`, try to use it apply to the current branch
1. After modifications, push the code to our repository. Then it will trigger the build https://jenkins.visenze.com/job/kubernetes-cluster-autoscaler/
1. Then we can test it in staging environment.


#How to test the cluster autoscaler work 
1. Test if gpu related resources can trigger the scaling up and scaling down with this pod definition.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    visenze.component: search
    visenze.gpu: "true"
  containers:
    - name: digits-container
      image: nvcr.io/nvidia/digits:20.12-tensorflow-py3
      #image: banst/awscli
      resources:
        limits:
          #visenze.com/nvidia-gpu-memory: 4988051968
          #visenze.com/nvidia-mps-context: 9
           nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

#Note
* If it can work, then generate and commit a new patch for the next version upgrade. The command to generate the patch:
 `git diff [commit that before applying the patch] ':(exclude)cluster-autoscaler/go.mod' ':(exclude)cluster-autoscaler/go.sum' > patch/1.18.patch`
